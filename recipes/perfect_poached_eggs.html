    <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>
            What would eggs benedict be without perfect soft-poached eggs, their snowy whites napped in a robe of 
            gloriously thick, buttery real hollandaise and liquid gold yolks ready to ooze out over your ham and 
            into the nooks and crannies of your buttered and toasted English muffin?
        </p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>3 quarts water</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons kosher salt</li>
        <li>Large eggs (as many as desired)</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>

        <li>
            <p>
                Combine the water and salt in a large saucepan and 
                bring to a boil over high heat, then reduce the heat to
                the lowest setting.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>
                Carefully break the eggs into individual small bowls or cups.
                Carefully tip one egg into a fine-mesh strainer set over a bowl 
                and allow the excess white to drain, swirling the strainer gently.
                You should be left with the yolk surrounded by tight egg white. 
                Gently lower the strainer into the water, then tilt the egg out into 
                the water. Repeat with the remaining eggs.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>
                Allow the eggs to cook, swirling the water occasionally to keep them
                moving lazily around the pan and gently turning them, until the whites
                are fully set but the yolks are still runny, about 4 mintues.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>
                To serve immediately, pick up the eggs one at a time with a perforated
                spoon and transfer to a paper-towel-lined plate to drain briefly. Serve.
            </p>
        </li>

                Or, to save the eggs for later, pick up the eggs one at a time with a 
                perforated spoon and transfer to a bowl of cold water to chill, then store
                submerged in the water in the refrigerator for up to 3 days. To reheat,
                transfer to a bowl of hot water and allow to stand until warm, about 15 mintues.
            </p>
