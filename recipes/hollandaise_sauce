    <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>
            For many aspiring Frech chefs, great hollandaise is the bane of their
            existence. Far removed from the gloppy, greasy stuff you get the typical
            diner, or worse, the powdered "just add milk" cafeteria version, a true
            hollandaise is creamy and rich, impossibly smooth, and perfectly well 
            balanced with the flavors of eggs, butter, and a touch of lemon juice. It
            should flow slowly off the spoon so that it naps a poached egg in a thick 
            robe.
        </p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>3 large egg yolks</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon lemon juice (from 1 lemon)</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon hot water</li>
        <li>1/2 pound (2 sticks) unsalted butter, cut into rough, tablespoon sized chunks</li>
        <li>Pinch of cayenne pepper</li>
        <li>Kosher salt</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>

                Add the egg yolks, lemon juice, and hot water to a blendr or food 
                processor and blend on medium speed until smooth, about 10 seconds.

                Melt the butter in a small saucepan over medium-low heat and continue
                to heat until the butter just begins to bubble and registers 180&deg; 
                to 190&deg;F on an instant-read thermometer.
            </p>
        </li>

            <p>
                With the blender running on medium speed, slowly drizzle in the butter
                over the course of 1 minute, stopping to scrape down the sides as necessary
                and leaving the thin layer of whitish liquid in the bottom of the pan (discard
                it). The sauce should be smooth, with the consistency of heavy cream. Season
                with the cayenne and salt to taste. Transfer to a serving bowl or small saucepan,
                cover, and keep in a warm spot (not directly over heat!) until ready to serve.
